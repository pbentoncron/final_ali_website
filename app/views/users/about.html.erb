            Hi, my name is Alison Cron. I have always had a passion for people and art, which transitioned into a passion for hair and beauty. I started at the Aveda Institute in Dallas and worked at an Aveda salon in Fort Worth for three years. I love everything about hair but especially dimensional color. I think it is important to have integrity in all aspects of your life, especially in the way you run a business. My intention is for my guest to love their hair and leave the salon feeling the best version of themselves; I truly adore my guests and the relationships I am able to build with them. I look forward to working with you!

                <p>At Hair by Ali Cron, we use Kevin Murphy color and products. The color line is honey based leaving your hair shiny, soft, and moisturized-"What goes inside the tube is just as important as the colour it creates. The choices we made are PPD free, ammonia free and naturally derived ingredients like aloe vera, honey, shea butter, and pomegranate."</p>
